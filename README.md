# What we will do
## Abstract
Asteroids are ancient space rocks left over from the formation of the Solar System. Huge impactswith Earth are quite rare; however, even those that disintegrate in Earthâ€™s atmosphere can createexplosive airbursts, with resulting shockwaves that may shatter glass, damage buildings and injureanyone who happens to be nearby [Esa - Risk Asteroids](https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Risky_asteroids). The necessity to always monitor their position is thereforebecoming more and more imperative, in order to systematically assess the magnitude of this threat: inthis context MORPHEUS mission will be placed, whose aim is to release a marker on four potentiallyhazardous asteroids in order to always allow their tracing.In the following report, firstly an analysis of the environment the system will be subjected to isperformed, followed by the setting up of a procedure to identify the possible targets of the mission.Afterwards, the state-of-the-art of past, current and future technologies is analyzed, to provide areference for MORPHEUS design. A functional decomposition is then assessed, together with thedriving aspects of the mission and a first identification of the requirements, provided in an attacheddedicated document. Finally, some architectures are proposed and eventually a preliminary draftingof mission phases and conceptual operations is carried out.
